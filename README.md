Project Overview

The project you’ll build in this tutorial consists of a command-line application that takes a directory path as an argument, walks through its internal structure, and generates a treelike diagram listing the contents of the directory at hand. In this section, you’ll take a first look at the problem and a possible solution. You’ll also decide how to lay out the project.
